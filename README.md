> NOTE: This project is not originally mine. It was created by the incredibly talented YouTube channel [The Office Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@theofficelab) , which published a nearly 10-hour tutorial that I followed to build this tracker. I highly recommend their content to anyone interested in Excel dashboards, finance, and productivity. Their tutorials are insightful, detailed, and incredibly well-structured – this project is a testament to that. Huge thanks to [The Office Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@theofficelab) for making this learning experience possible.
